# Real Ruins

Development considerations:
Since the mod initially was cobbled together in a couple of days, it's pretty messy inside. But it works and users demand new features, so
there are the following rules I try to follow to deliver product while trying to make it better from the inside.
Also please remember that C# is not my native language, so most likely there are many places where I can use much better approach.

working product > architecture. I need to keep this working, so architectural refactoring is an important task, but bugfixes have higher priority.
architecture > proper errors handling. Code is really messy, so for now I want to make it tidy and structured, and only after that do all "what if" stuff.
architecture > new features. Code state is at the point where it can be hardly extended. It needs refactoring and this is what I'm doing right now.
errors handling > optimization. 
speed > memory.
